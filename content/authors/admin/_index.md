**Who am I?**

My name is Dean Weber. I am a Senior Web and Application Developer with Simon Property Group and this is my first blog. After many years of toying with the idea of blogging, I finally took the plunge and scrabbled together the rudiments of this site. My intent is for this to be a medium for expressing my interests in software development as I stretch and continue to grow my understanding of various topics and software development skills. Welcome to my journey as I dabble and opine on the art of software craftsmanship. Learning is a life long quest. Although it's been a bumpy ride over the years hopefully the remainder of the trip will be most enjoyable with some adventure and a pleasant surprises along the way.

**Some historical details about me**

I am a first generation American whose parents settled here from Germany. I've an eclectic background having been raised in the Midwest (Indiana) and spent much of my early career on the West Coast (California). While at Purdue University I studied computers and received my first black belt in Tae Kwon Do under Master Kwang Lee. Upon graduating with a B.S. in Computer and Electrical Engineering, I moved to California. While there I learned to fly hang gliders, scuba dive, and trained in Aikido under Sensei Reynosa of Makoto Dojo. Formerly a student of Steven Seagal, we enjoyed many opportunities to train with him at his ranch in Santa Barbara and Boseman Montana. I've traveled to Japan with my former dojo and created many life long memories. I suppose it's the European blood in me makes me love travel. I have visited the far reaches of the Earth. I've been as far north as Fairbanks Alaska, as far south as Santiago Chile, as far East as Tokyo and Osaka Japan and have visited a fair share of European countries including Germany, France, Italy, Monaco, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg and a few others I've long since forgotten from my tours with my family in my youth.  

I am now in Indianapolis, IN and raising two lovely sons with my wife Kathy. I still love computers even after the bumpy road since leaving So Cal and most definitely following 9/11. I am passionate about software development which prompted me to get my 4 different .NET certifications from Microsoft, MCTS:.NET Web, MCTS:.NET Windows, MCTS: .NET Distributed Apps, MCPD: Enterprise Application Development. While in Indy, I've worked at various companies in several different markets. In the defense industry, I did some great and interesting things at Raytheon in the software engineering department. Leaving there I joined Simon Property Group about 10 years ago where I now build better web and mobile experiences for marketers, shoppers and retailers. 

I am always keen to learn about the next new development thing. Things have come full circle and I am following my true passion (outside of my family and God). I am currently learning about RPM, Rapid Prompt Method, a mechanism to help non-verbal individuals on the autism spectrum to communicate. In my role as an autism advocate I've studied genetics, biology, brain chemistry and how the brain works. I hope to one day apply what I am learning to developing software that will help children and adults with developmental disabilities learn to speak, behave appropriately and relate socially. 

I love to read and am always immersed in several books simultaneously. I read on a variety of topics from .NET development to self-improvement to spiritual and inspirational to political.
