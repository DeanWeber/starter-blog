**Who am I?**

I am Dean Weber Senior Web and Application Developer with Simon Property Group and this is my first blog. After many years of toying with the idea of blogging, I finally took the plunge and scrabbled together the rudiments of this site. My intent is for this to be a medium for expressing my interests in software development as a stretch and continue to grow my understanding of various topics. Learning is a life long quest. Welcome to my journey as I dabble and opine on the art of software craftsmanship.



**More boring details about me ...**

I am a first generation American whose parents settled here from Germany. He has an eclectic background having been raised in the Midwest (Indiana) and spent much of his early career on the West Coast (California). and Tae Kwon Do while at Purdue University. Upon graduating with a B.S. in Computer and Electrical Engineering, I moved to California. While there I learned to fly hang gliders, scuba dive, and trained in Aikido under Sensei Reynosa of Makoto Dojo. Formerly a student of Steven Seagal, we enjoyed many opportunities to train with him at his ranch in Santa Barbara and Boseman Monatana. I've traveled to Japan with my former dojo and created many life long memories. I guess the European blood in me makes me love travel. I have visited the far reaches of the Earth. I've been as far north as Fairbanks Alaska, as far south as Santiago Chile, as far East as Tokyo and Osaka Japan and have visited a fair share of European countries including Germany, France, Italy, Monaco, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg and a few others I've long forgotten. Now I am back in Indianapolis, IN and raising two lovely boys with my wife Kathy. I still love computers but have hit a bumpy road in my career following 9/11. I am passionate about software development which prompted me to get my 4 different .NET certifications from Microsoft, MCTS:.NET Web, MCTS:.NET Windows, MCTS: .NET Distributed Apps, MCPD: Enterprise Application Development. I did some great things at Raytheon in the software engineering department. I am now working at Simon Property Group building a better web and mobile experience, although I'm mostly waiting on the mobile stuff. I am always keen to learn about the next new development thing. Things have come full circle and I am following my true passion (outside of my family and God). I am currently learning about RDI, Relationship Developmental Intervention, and studying genetics, biology, brain chemistry and how the brain works. I hope to one day apply what I am learning to developing software that will help children with developmental problems learn to speak, behave appropriately and relate socially. I love to read and am always immersed in several books simultaneously. I read on a variety of topics from .NET development to self-improvement to spiritual and inspirational to political.
